We didnâ€™t have time to implement the acceleration structures unfortunately. We were planning to do a Bounding Volume Hierarchy, implemented with a KD-tree but we decided we needed time to do our other school projects because it was taking too much time to implement.
It was a fun project. Please check README.md for compilation instructions (just type make), although it should work provided that you're on a Mac or Unix system.
